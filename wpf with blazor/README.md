This is a template for creating a WPF project combined with BLAZOR, allows you to build WPF applications combined with Blazor's new capabilities, among the great benefits that can be the ability to build one hybrid application for Web and Desktop, and design capabilities using CSS combined with Built-in design libraries or JavaScript libraries and all this with the great capabilities of Dotnet and C #
This project comes with the familiar BLAZOR page template you can change them as you wish.
Note that Hot Reload can also be done in building the app on the WEB part as well as in a standard WPF app it works when you run it in Debug mode


Note that this project was built in the Dotnet 7 framework, but as you know you can easily migrate to a more up-to-date DOTNET version.
All you need to use the project is to download the zip file of the template (name is - Wpf With Blazor.zip) and then copy it to this path (if you are working with Windows) = C:\Users\[YOUR USER NAME]\Documents\Visual Studio 2022\Templates\ProjectTemplates.
This is the default place of the templates unless you set it elsewhere
Then go to Visual Studio and you will see that a new template called WPF with Blazor has been added, select this option and build the project. Note that NuGet Packages is required so build the project with an internet connection.
Start your new project - good luck!.
